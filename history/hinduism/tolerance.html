<p>
TL;DR &#x2014; there are certain non-negotiable core Hindu values; apart from that, there is a lot of tolerance in transient cultural elements (including pantheons), and also complete openness to new scientific knowledge regardless of authority.
</p>

<p>
A common rāytā-coded meme: &ldquo;Hinduism can blend syncretically with any religion, the problem with Islam/Christianity is it demands exclusivity&rdquo;. Zoomers who are offended by this reddit-brained suggestion that Hinduism is nihilistic and anything-goes, overcorrect by going &ldquo;NOOO actually we are very intolerant and think of mlecchas as inferioor!!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This is a good example of <i>thinking on the wrong axis</i>. You are so subconsciously tuned into thinking in liberal frameworks like &ldquo;tolerance vs intolerance&rdquo;, &ldquo;oppressor vs oppressed&rdquo; that even if you oppose the liberal view, you can only swing away from it on their own axis &#x2014; instead of developing your worldview from your own principles, you remain confined to the axis created by liberals.
</p>

<p>
So how might we understand how the ancients, in their own frameworks, viewed other cultures and religions? Here&rsquo;s something that might be relevant:
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgf3f8946" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf3f8946"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Sanskritization, and treatment of conquered mlecchas</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Here, Kautilya describes how an Ārya conqueror ought to treat a mleccha land he acquires.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
He should adopt the same mode of life, the same dress, language, and customs as those of the people. He should follow the people in their faith with which they celebrate their national, religious and congregational festivals or amusements.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
He should always hold righteous/religious life in high esteem. Learned men, orators, charitable and brave persons should be favoured with gifts of land and money and with remission of taxes &#x2026; he should prohibit the slaughter of animals for half a month during the period of Cháturmásya (from July to September), for four nights during the full moon, and for a night on the day of the birth-star of the conqueror or of the national star.
</p>

<p>
He should also prohibit the slaughter of females and young ones (yonibálavadham) as well as castration. Having abolished those customs or transactions which he might consider either as injurious to the growth of his revenue and army or as unrighteous, he should establish righteous transactions.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
He should initiate the observance of all those customs, which, though righteous and practised by others, are not observed in his own country, and give no room for the practice of whatever is unrighteous, though observed by others.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014;Kautilya, in the Arthaśāstra, 13.5
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(the section as a whole more generally refers to how to treat any conquered land, but these excerpted portions only make sense with regard to foreign lands, which lines up with the context of Mauryan rule in much of Afghanistan and Balochistan.)
</p>

<p>
In summary:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Abolish wicked practices, e.g. cow &amp; calf slaughter, bad economic policies</li>
<li>Embrace local customs, dresses, festivals, gods</li>
<li>Learn their good practices; abolish the bad</li>
<li>Otherwise act in accordance with sacred law</li>
<li>Hold Hindu culture (&ldquo;Righteous Life&rdquo;) to be highest-status, i.e. as the &ldquo;high culture&rdquo; of the land &#x2014; aka &ldquo;Sanskritization&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
This sheds light on the Hindu approach to syncretism. <b><i>Core values, principles and philosophy</i> were non-negotiable, while we were exceptionally tolerant and syncretic in superficial &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; elements</b> like customs, dresses, festivals and even flexibly admitting foreign deities. One may observe a parallel to Hindu philosophy, where it is Brahman that is fundamental and (at least in Advaita), all deities are seen as expansions of the same Brahman.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgab51775" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgab51775"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What might we consider &ldquo;core principles&rdquo; of Hinduism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Brahman</b> as a philosophically fundamental concept, and the associated Vedic literature and philosophy</li>
<li><b>The three goals</b>, or Puruṣārtha: Artha (wealth), Kāma (pleasure), Dharma (righteous behaviour)</li>
<li><b>The three obligations/debts</b>, or Ṛṇatraya: to gods (to follow the religion), to rṣis (to learn, advance and pass down knowledge) and to one&rsquo;s ancestors (to produce children)</li>
<li><b>The four sciences</b>: the Vedas and associated Vedāṅgas (which include the study of grammar and language), Ānvīkṣakī (hard science), Vārtā (practical work or commercial knowledge), Daṇḍa-nītī (government)</li>
<li><b>Śāstra</b>: following the injunctions in the Dharmaṣāstras (moral literature) and Arthaṣāstra (economic/political literature)</li>
<li><b>Indriyajaya</b>: Practising restraint over sensual pleasures, &ldquo;conquering your inner enemies&rdquo; as something <a href="/history/hinduism/restraint.html">instrumentally valuable</a> for your other goals</li>
<li><b>The prohibition on cow and calf slaughter</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This also doesn&rsquo;t pin things too precisely. The Dharmaśāstras are various, and neither they nor the Arthaśāstra can be regarded as timeless; similarly on the primary point there are multiple conflicting philosophies. The enumerations differ: some texts include mokṣa as a Puruṣārtha; some include more obligations. The &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; school of Bṛhaspati lists only Vārtā (work knowledge) and Daṇḍa-nītī (government) as the sciences, while the school of Śukra (which in many ways is a &ldquo;dark&rdquo; version of Bṛhaspati) lists only Daṇḍa-nītī in a &ldquo;only power matters&rdquo; kind of way.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless it sheds light on what &ldquo;type&rdquo; of thing is universal, and what is subject to change with region, tribe and time period.
</p>

<p>
Although the excerpt from Kautilya is about an Ārya conqueror ruling a mleccha land, the same pattern is observed with foreign invading tribes that assimilated into the Hindu fold, e.g. here are some inscriptions from the Western Satraps (admittedly, they may not have been so foreign &#x2014; assuming they decended from the Apracas, their origins seem to have be paternally Kamboja Hindus and only maternally Scythian, nonetheless they were culturally the latter and identified as such before they established their empire)

<p>
They repeatedly proclaim their acceptance of Hindu philosophy and the sciences, and a knowledgeable reader may spot many nods to Artha/Dharma-śāstric prescriptions for governance: building hydraulic infrastructure, hunting down robbers and wild beasts, grants of land and cows to Brāhmaṇas, establishment of non-sectarian monasteries etc.

<div id="outline-container-org4f40a17" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4f40a17"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Hindu attitude towards science</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The above addresses the question about the Hindu attitude to syncretizing foreign cultural elements. We may similarly ask: what is the Hindu attitude to accepting foreign or new ideas on <i>objective</i> or scientific matters?
</p>

<p>
The crispest answer to this is given by Kumarila Bhaṭṭa, who says: <i>we are free to admit the superior authority of mlecchas on any given wordly science</i>. The Ārya have superior authority in religion, not necessarily in anything else, where we are free to learn from anyone. The Manusmṛti also famously states:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
श्रद्दधानः शुभां विद्यामाददीतावरादपि ।
अन्यादपि परं धर्मं स्त्रीरत्नं दुष्कुलादपि ॥ २३८ ॥
</p>

<p>
śraddadhānaḥ śubhāṃ vidyāmādadītāvarādapi |
anyādapi paraṃ dharmaṃ strīratnaṃ duṣkulādapi || 238 ||
</p>

<p>
One imbued with faith may acquire excellent learning even from a lowly person, special law even from the lowest, and the gem of a wife even from a base family.—(238)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similar attitudes are expressed by Vācaspati Miśra and Vātsyāyana of the Nyāya school.

<div id="outline-container-org9a44d2a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9a44d2a"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Pramāṇa, or epistemology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
More fundamentally when it comes to scientific matters, Hindu epistemology rests on the concept of <b>Pramāṇa</b>, meaning &ldquo;proof&rdquo; or &ldquo;way of knowing&rdquo;. The six Pramāṇas described in the literature are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>pratyakṣa</i> (sense perception/observation)</li>
<li><i>anumāna</i> (logical inference)</li>
<li><i>śabda</i> (word)</li>
<li><i>upamāna</i> (analogy)</li>
<li><i>arthāpatti</i> (called &ldquo;postulation&rdquo;, but in practice not different from anumāna)</li>
<li><i>anupalabdhi</i> (absence)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Only the first three are &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; and universally enumerated in most Hindu literature (though some Vaiśeṣika literature does not mention śabda, perhaps subsuming it as a form of pratyakṣa), while the rest may be regarded as specific forms of argument popular in Hindu philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The first two are fundamental to science of course (&ldquo;logical positivism&rdquo; in the terms of modern philosophy). Śabda is mainly a nod to the authority of the Vedas &#x2014; so the materialist Bārhaspatyas reject it, as do Buddhist logicians (who mostly derived from the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika schools of Hinduism) though in practice the Buddhists relied heavily on the word of Siddhārtha Gautama.
</p>

<p>
Much of the epistemological literature centers on discussing which pramāṇas are more reliable, and which take precedence over which. Interestingly, it is universally acknowledged that pratyakṣa and anumāna take precedence over all others. Rāmānuja writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For it is an acknowledged principle that Scripture has meaning only with regard to what is not established by other sources of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ādi Śaṅkara writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Surely, even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or non-luminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is cold or non-luminous, even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different, for otherwise (its) validity cannot be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement.
</p>

<p>
The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra etc., which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc., because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is not considered a rejection of the authority of the Vedas, rather it pins down its domain to the realm of philosophy and ritual &#x2014; any other claim made in passing does not hold authority.
