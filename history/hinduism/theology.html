The history of Hinduism &#x2014; and the cultural history of India at large &#x2014; is the history of assimilation.
</p>

<p>
The culture of the ancient Vedic elites occupies the dominant role in our understanding of Indian history due to their superiority in transmitting knowledge and their cosmopolitanism; however, throughout time there have been distinct cultures on this land, whose histories are shrouded in relative mystery, but which were eventually syncretized into the great alloy that is the Indian ethos of today.
</p>

<p>
This is a topic that gets a lot of unwanted attention from half-witted &ldquo;sub-nationalist/separatist&rdquo; (i.e.¬†Periyarist, Ambedkarite, Khalistani, caste kangers) movements: these people&rsquo;s historical knowledge is limited to idiotic interpretations of a few popular myths (‚ÄùVƒÅmana-Bali/Mahi≈õƒÅsura is about Aryans and Dravidians‚Äù, &ldquo;Mohini/ArdhanƒÅrƒ´≈õvara is about LGBT&rdquo;). These crackpot delusions are anachronistic projections of simplistic racial narratives on the past, yet often obtain approval from mainstream writers due to the unholy leftist-subnat alliance. However, they are easily washed away with a rational and dispassionate analysis of the topic, which is what we will do here.
</p>

<p>
The history of Indian theology is however a rather vast topic, and this article only provides a broad overview. For those who want to read precise details, the undisputed living expert on this topic is mƒÅnasa-tara·πÉgi·πáƒ´ (<a href="https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/the-complete-index/">blog</a>, <a href="/history/hinduism/theology.html">history/hinduism/theology.org</a>).

<p>
Early Vedic literature mentions a number of outgroups &#x2014; noobs often incorrectly map this onto &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dravidian&rdquo; (categorizations which do not reflect how people in the Vedic era saw themselves), so it is important to more reasonably identify who these groups were.
</p>

<p>
<b>List</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Dasyu</b> &#x2014; an Iranian people; presumably they were defeated and mass-enslaved in some war, leading to their ethnonym becoming synonymous for &ldquo;servant&rdquo;. See Encyclopedia Iranica&rsquo;s entry on Dahyu [1x.1], and this Stack Exchange answer [1x.2] refuting claims that they were of dark complexion.</li>
<li><b>Mleccha</b> &#x2014; the earliest mention of this is from <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/satapatha-brahmana-sanskrit/d/doc1052498.html">≈öatapatha BrƒÅhma·πáa 3.2.1.23-24</a>, which contains a sample of Mleccha speech (‚Äùhe &rsquo;lavah! he &rsquo;lavah!‚Äù), and generally referred to an unintelligible language (due to the importance of precision of speech to the ƒÄrya identity, it became a generic out-group identifier, like &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo;). (Etymology unclear; it may be related to &ldquo;Melu·∏´·∏´a‚Å†&rdquo;, the Mesopotamian word for the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), but in this case I would speculate that the term really originated from an IVC term for the Baloch highlands, and was used for the IVC as a whole by the Mesopotamians due to its proximity to them)</li>
<li><b>Pa·πái</b> &#x2014; a wealthy mercantile people, derided for their wealth in the rÃ•g Veda but assimilated as Vai≈õyas via the creation of the caste system in the Post-RV period (1000&#x2014;800 BC). The term itself is cognate with Norse &ldquo;Vanir&rdquo;, the gods of commerce, similarly derided.</li>
<li><b>≈öi≈õnadeva</b> &#x2014; phallus-worshippers in the rÃ•g Veda, probably a precursor to Lingam-worship. Later commentaries interpret the term instead as &ldquo;unchaste people&rdquo;.</li>
<li><b>NƒÅga</b> &#x2014; the term nƒÅga itself is not mentioned in Vedic literature, (the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata is first to use it), but the Vedic literature extensively speaks of a cult of <i>sarpasatra</i>, &ldquo;The Serpent Sacrifice&rdquo;, which may variously refer to a sacrifice <i>by</i> serpents, <i>of</i> serpents, or <i>to</i> serpents. A comprehensive source on this is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43715700">[2] van den Hoek &amp; Shrestha (1992), &ldquo;The Sacrifice of Serpents: Exchange and Non-Exchange in the Sarpabali of IndrƒÅya·πáƒ´, Kathmandu&rdquo;</a>.</li>
<li><b>VrƒÅtya</b> &#x2014; fierce wandering ascetics; they were undoubtedly precursor to the ≈öaivite sect (they are mentioned in conjunction with deities such as Rudra and Pa≈õupati) as well as to the ascetic (≈õrama·πáa) influences on <a href="/history/hinduism/philosophy.html">history/hinduism/philosophy.org</a>. A comprehensive source on this is <a href="https://sreenivasaraos.com/2012/09/13/who-were-the-vratyas-the-searching-wanderers/">[3] ‚ÄùWho were the VrƒÅtyas?‚Äù by Sreenivas Rao</a>.</li>
<li><b>Ni·π£ƒÅda</b> &#x2014; a tribe that was &ldquo;neither forest-dwelling nor settled&rdquo; and were eventually assimilated into Vedic society, part of them Sanskritized into fully-enfranchised ƒÄryas, part remained untouchable, and part expelled to frontier regions in the South and the East; see <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150465/page/n67/mode/2up">[4]‚Äã</a> and also later-cited [6x.1] which claims them to be related to the modern Nihali people.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Speculative claims about Pa·πáis:</b>
</p>

<p>
The revival of many IVC traditions in the Second Urbanization (800 BC onward) is well-known, e.g.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Units of mass: the classical Indian unit of mass is the <i>ratti</i>, the weight of a gunja seed ~0.113g. The ≈öatapatha BrƒÅhma·πáa which mentions a unit called the ≈öatamƒÅna which is 100 krÃ•·π£·πáalƒÅs, and the krÃ•·π£·πáalƒÅ is <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/krishnala">widely</a> attested by later literature to be the same as a ratti; Gandharan coins from the Second Urbanization up to the time of Kautilya measure 100 rattis; the KƒÅr·π£ƒÅpa·πáa itself is 32 rattis; the Artha≈õƒÅstra claims the <i>purƒÅ·πáa</i> or &ldquo;old&rdquo; system of measurement had a standard of 32 rattis but proposes instead an 80-ratti standard called <i>svar·πáa</i> which was use from Mauryan times onwards. Now what&rsquo;s interesting is that the IVC weights belonged to a binary scale 1:2:4:8:16:32 where the smallest weight coincided with exactly 8 rattis, and the most commonly used weight was scale 4, i.e.¬†32 rattis, exactly what the Artha≈õƒÅstra calls the old system of measurement. Sources: [5x.1-2]</li>
<li>Units of length: An ivory scale from Lothal has decimal divisions with each graduation of length 1.7mm, ten of these graduations equals the a·πÖgula according to the Artha≈õƒÅstra and such. Sources: [5x.3-5].</li>
<li>Symbols on coinage: The Mohenjodaro class IV silver pieces and class D pieces are &ldquo;remarkably similar&rdquo; to later punch-marked coins [5x.6], and the symbols on IVC <i>seals</i> famously bear close resemblance to punch-marked coins [5x.7]. It is worth noting is that the IVC had &ldquo;metals of fixed weight&rdquo; for commerce, i.e.¬†bullion/coins but without stamping [5x.8-13], and that the rÃ•g Veda itself mentions the term <i>ni·π£ka</i>, which was at least later used to refer to coins explicitly, and even the Rig Veda use is suggestive (e.g.¬†RV <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc830255.html">4.37.4</a>, <a href="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/rig-veda-english-translation/d/doc830255.html">1.126.2</a>) although the unambiguous use of the term to refer to currency only appears in Ma·πádala 1 which was composed later (1000&#x2014;800 BC). For a contrary perspective, see Cunningham [5x.14] who believes the weight of a kƒÅr·π£ƒÅpa·πáa coincided with that of the Phonecian shekel and thus derived from it.</li>
<li>Misc: ivory dice, baked brick construction, bangles, generally similar craft industries, baths and stepwells, Yoga and meditative practices (if the so-called Pa≈õupati seal is to be regarded as evidence for such). Sources: [5x.15].</li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on the especial prominence of activities related to trade and finance in these, and the fact that modern <i>baniya</i> (mercantile) castes have the greatest proportion of IVC ancestry, I am inclined to suggest that the Pa·πái were the descendants of the IVC mercantile elite who preserved various IVC traditions and crafts into the Vedic period. Note also the similarity between the terms <i>pa·πái</i> and <i>pa·πáa</i> and the derivation <i>pa·πái</i> ‚Üí <i>va·πáij</i> ‚Üí <i>baniya</i>.
</p>

<p>
The comprehensive resource on this topic is <a href="https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.107464/page/129/mode/2up">[5] SC Malik (1968), Indian Civilization: the formative period</a>, who postulates a similar theory. However, note that the book does make some mistakes, such as claiming the word <i>pura</i> has no Indo-European cognate (the Greek cognate is <i>polis</i>).
</p>

<p>
<b>Speculative comments about NƒÅgas:</b>
</p>

<p>
You will often see claims variously associating the NƒÅgas with tribes in Northeast India, Southeast Asia or Central-East India. Certainly, the term was later used to describe these tribes, but is quite absurd to claim that they all belonged to some widespread &ldquo;NƒÅga culture&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Instead, it seems to me that the NƒÅgas were a <i>symbol of Hindu assimilation</i>: a label assigned to any people who were initially foreign and hostile to the ƒÄryas but eventually yielding to our ways. Of course, the motif would have been based on a real serpent-worshipping culture in the time of the Kuru kingdom (1000&#x2014;900 BC), who were initially hostile to the Kurus but eventually made peace with them and assimilated culturally, as attested in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata in the story of Janamejaya and Tak·π£aka.
</p>

<p>
(Note that I am willing to accept the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata for information on the Vedic period despite its varied period of composition ~1000 BC&#x2014;400, because e.g.¬†the sarpasatra is independently attested by Vedic literature without appearing to have been copied.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Note on demons:</b>
</p>

<p>
Sub-nat circles suffer from the Euhemeristic tendency of believing every mythic or legendary race of &ldquo;demons&rdquo; must be based on some race of people (invariably their own), e.g.¬†Asura, Daitya, DƒÅnava, RƒÅk·π£asa, Yak·π£a. None of these are of Euhemeristic origin: <i>Asura</i> was a generic honorific for a powerful being like &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; and grew a negative connotation due to the popularity of David-vs-Goliath-style storytelling; this was <i>not</i> due to some conflict against the Zoroastrians, who simply retained the positive meaning of <i>Asura</i> (however, the Zoroastrian rejection of the <i>Devas</i> as demons <i>was</i> due to their dissent from the prevailing Vedic or para-Vedic culture in their early homeland in Afghanistan). The term <i>RƒÅk·π£asa</i> first appears in the epics, and based on its etymology (‚Äùprotector‚Äù) could have either have been motivated by wild tribes protecting forests from the light of civilization or by guards of castles and treasures in heroic mythology. Alternatively they could be based on the Rak·π£as people of Baluchistan mentioned by PƒÅ·πáini 5.3.117 (see VS Agarwala). <i>DƒÅnava</i> frequently occurs in the rÃ•g Veda; both only appear in the PurƒÅ·πáas; <i>Daitya</i> appears in classical texts such as the ManusmrÃ•iti only as celestial beings without any further negative connotation, both are purely mythical beings from their very conception. <i>Yak·π£a</i> is a minor nature spirit in the rÃ•g Veda itself, a similar class of beings as the <i>Gandharva</i>, etc.

<p>
All the aforementioned groups mentioned lived in the same geographic region as the Vedic people, i.e.¬†Udƒ´chya+BrahmƒÅvarta+Madhyade≈õa (Punjab+Haryana+UP) &#x2014; except the VrƒÅtyas who in the latter Vedic period settled the Magadha region (see source [3]), and perhaps the Mlecchas who I might have been of Sindh or the Baloch highlands. What, then, were the religions and cultures in the rest of the Loka, pre-Maurya?
</p>

<p>
<b>Language distribution:</b> One piece of information is the current distribution of languages, which suggests a peninsular distribution of the Dravidian languages, Eastern distribution of Munda (Austro-asiatic), and the language isolates of Nihali, Burushaki, Kusunda and the remnants in Vedda, which may at one point have had a wider distribution.

</p>

<p>
<b>Substrate identification:</b> However, it is quite difficult to imagine that e.g.¬†Dravidian could have had such a wide geographical distribution in neolithic/chalcolithic times, and this also doesn&rsquo;t answer any question about the &ldquo;pre-Aryan&rdquo; languages in the North, or the language of the IVC. Certainly if we are willing to entertain that Nihali could have once had a wider distribution, then so could any language completely lost to us today. To have any shot at answering these questions, one must study <i>substrates</i> in extant languages: words in the language not attested in any cognate language, and which share some structure. Hypothesized substrates in Vedic Sanskrit:

Also worthy of note is the &ldquo;Inner-Outer hypothesis&rdquo; of e.g.¬†Zoller [6x.5] (see also the comments by mƒÅnasatara·πÉgi·πáƒ´ therein) which postulates two waves of Aryan migrations into India, one with more archaic Indo-Iranic features, preserved in the North-West, and another a standard Indo-Aryan one.

<b>MƒÅlaya tribe:</b> The talk of a &ldquo;para-Munda&rdquo; language in Punjab may strike one as odd given its generally presumed Eastern provenance (indeed, Munda resurfaces in the names of Eastern provinces). However, a major Austro-asiatic presence has been noted by several authors including:

</p>

<p>
E.g. Majumdar suggests that the various MƒÅlayas:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the MƒÅlava tribe of Punjab that migrated to Ujjain or vice versa (attested as MƒÅlaya in some coins, this is a standard sound change), and the related name &ldquo;Malwa&rdquo; for the Ujjain region</li>
<li>the Dravidian term <i>mala</i> for mountain, preserved in the name &ldquo;MƒÅlaya&rdquo; in Sanskrit literature for the Southern part of the Western ghats, and in the names MalayƒÅ·∏∑am and Malabar for Kerala</li>
<li>Malayaketu of the Mudra-RƒÅk·π£asa (interestingly the son of <i>Parvataka</i>, thus associated with mountains), MalayƒÅvati the wife of the Kuntala king ≈öƒÅtakar·πái SƒÅtavƒÅhana in the <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/sex/kama/kama207.htm">KƒÅmas≈´tra</a></li>
<li>Various Southeast Asian Malayas: Malaysia (Malayu, Malacca), Malayu in Sumatra, MƒÅla or MƒÅlava for Laos, Molucca islands in Eastern Indonesia</li>
<li>Maldives (MƒÅladvipa), Madagascar (whose people are known as Malagasy)</li>
<li>(Majumdar doesn&rsquo;t claim this) Perhaps even Melu·∏´·∏´a‚Å†?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Are related, and that the tribe is of Austro-asiatic, i.e.¬†&ldquo;Para-Munda&rdquo; origin.

<b>Fish-eater colonialism:</b> However incredible this claim of a great lost civilization spanning the seas in the LBA/EIA may seem, there is a third context wherein it has independently arisen, namely the early trade between the Indian West coast (both IVC Gujarat and the Konkan, Karnataka) and Sub-Saharan Africa [8x.1] [8x.2] and the mastery over the monsoon winds:

<p>
<b>Material cultures:</b> Perhaps we can get some hints from looking at archaeology? Here is a list of material cultures from North India known to archaeologists:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/img/snippetry/archaeological cultures.png" alt="archaeological cultures.png" />
</p>

<p>
Table S1 of [9x.1]
</p>

<p>
In the Deccan you have the famous megalithic culture (dolmens and such) and ashmounds, which I cannot even find reliable dating for, and in the Tamil country you have sites at Keezhadi, Adichanallur, Anuradhapura etc. But this is all really disappointingly unexplored and doesn&rsquo;t help us, though it is notable that the only clear examples we have of material cultures ~1300&#x2014;800BC outside the Vedic realm are those of Madhya Pradesh, something also attested in e.g.¬†the famous Bhimbetka caves. Indeed, even in the literature one observes the culture of the Pulindas is mentioned somewhat distinctly, e.g.¬†[9x.2].
</p>

<p>
<b>The RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa</b>
</p>

<p>
The RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa appears to be based on a combination of real events of importance from the 8th or 7th centuries BC as well as an account of information from the earliest ƒÄrya explorations of the peninsula (similar in mystique to e.g.¬†the accounts of Indica by Herodotus or Ctesias). If you accept this general view, then the ambiguous names in the RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa can be seen as a sample of words or names in the peninsula in those times: HanumƒÅn, VƒÅlƒ´, RƒÅva·πáa, , Ja·π≠ƒÅyu, SampƒÅti, Ki·π£kindhƒÅ, RumƒÅ, Khara (note the name of later Kali·πÖga king Kharavela), MƒÅlyavƒÅn &amp; related MƒÅli, MƒÅrƒ´ca, ≈öabarƒ´ (perhaps from the river ≈öabarƒ´, a tributary to the GodƒÅvarƒ´), TƒÅ·π≠akƒÅ (the yak·π£a).
</p>

<p>
I think that in cases where a place is said to be named after a character, it is likely to be the reverse. E.g. according to [10x.1], the ≈öabarƒ´ river is named after the &ldquo;≈öabara&rdquo;, a Telugu people; or the tale of Tak·π£aka in the MahƒÅbhƒÅrata indicating a NƒÅga culture in GandhƒÅra before the dominance of the Kurus, or the tale of Mahi·π£ƒÅsura for Mysore, of VƒÅtƒÅpi, of ≈ö≈´rpa·πáakhƒÅ based on the city of ≈ö≈´rparaka. Their true etymology may lie in some (lost?) peninsular language.
</p>

<p>
(There have been some claims that the VƒÅlmƒ´ki RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa actually does not refer to an expedition to the South, that La·πÖka is actually in Amaraka·πá·π≠aka in Madhya Pradesh and that its identification with Si·πÉhala comes from the period of the C≈ç·∏ªa imperialism in the island. This is definitively false: <a href="http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/kish/sarga41/kishkindha_41_frame.htm">VƒÅlmƒ´ki RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa 4.41</a> identifies the location of La·πÖkƒÅ as being in the South, past the PƒÅ·πádya country, opposite the ocean from the Mahendra mountains (Eastern Ghats): this can only be Sri Lanka. Besides, the RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa is quite explicit in its geography, describing an overall Southern voyage, e.g.¬†Pa√±cava·π≠ƒ´ forest, the site of Sƒ´tƒÅ&rsquo;s abduction, is on the GodƒÅvari river (<a href="http://www.valmikiramayan.net/aranya/sarga64/aranya_64_frame.htm">VƒÅlmƒ´ki RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa 3.64</a>) and probably identifiable as Nashik. In the 4th century, the La·πákƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, a Bauddha text, was composed in Si·πÉhala itself.)
