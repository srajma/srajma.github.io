<p>
To fight the Nobel Peace Prize syndrome, I am announcing the Nobel WAR Prize: awarded to the heroes who decisively defeated in WAR the forces of barbarism and nihilism which come in various forms like Left-liberalism and Steppe-nomad risk.
</p>

<p>
I award this to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the ancient Sumerians, for winning the WAR against nature by inventing agriculture and farming it</li>

<li>the rice-farmers, Wootz steel manufacturers, warlords and adventurous Ascetics of early Iron Age India who, clearing massive swathes of wild tracts, brought the most fertile land in the world under cultivation</li>

<li>Cāṇakya and Candragupta for manipulating the steppe hordes into a meat-grinder in their war for the throne of Pāṭaliputra, rendering them impotent for centuries; and then beginning the Silk Road Sanskritization project. &ldquo;Hind fucks, Śāka bucks&rdquo; as kids in ancient Arachosia used to say.</li>

<li>Emperor Wu for his successes against the Xiongnu.</li>

<li>Chandragupta-II, for expelling the mlecchas from the blackbuck&rsquo;s natural habitat and presiding over the Golden Age.</li>

<li>Yaśodharman of Malwa for uniting the Āryas to end the Hun menace, which would secure the border for 700 years to come</li>

<li>Ivan the Terrible, for bringing the entire steppe under his boot—ending Steppe-Nomad risk in its original form forever, and forging an entirely new type of Civilization.</li>

<li>Shivaji and those who came after him, for uprooting the Mlecchavaṃśa and establishing a Hindu Svarājya bathed in the two most sacred liquids: the water of the Ganges and the blood of its enemies—for establishing, beyond doubt, that THIS FORTRESS OF CIVILIZATION SHALL NOT FALL.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Today again, the forces of barbarism have returned: in the form of
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the Left-liberal Rāj, which seeks to impose upon the world its ideology of Dehātization, a perverse and inverted view of morality: in which the criminal is promoted over the civilized, the leech over the productive and industrious man, the protesting obstacle over the capitalist, barbarian and backward cultures over civilizing ones, degenerate lifestyles over healthy ones, civilizational suicide over reproduction, nature over Man and rioting luddites over machines and technology.</li>
<li>and its lawfully-wedded bride, Islamism.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Who will be be the next hero to win the Nobel WAR Prize? Will it be Netanyahu and Mossad? Will it be Modi and the Hindutva movement? Will it be Elon Musk and the tech right? Will it be you, anon?
</p>

<p>
Who will defeat the forces of barbarism today—who will win the Mandate of the Nobel WAR Prize?
</p>

<p>
Nothing makes me more patriotic for The Republic than seeing low-signal shitslops cry about how their hometown is no longer the quiet hobbit shithole without running water it used to be.
</p>

<p>
Your petty family businesses will be replaced by a corporate megapolis. Your ancestral home will be torn down and replaced with 1000-story skyscrapers. We will raze your serene mountains and run trains through them.
</p>

<p>
You will eat Idli-dosa with paneer, pay obeisance to Śivājī and say Jai Śrī Rām, dance to Punjabi lyrics about kuḍi and munḍa, speak Hindi and English, clean the gutkha, say &ldquo;Tamil is the oldest language&rdquo;, and you will LIKE it.
</p>

<p>
Your kulchur, history, jaat, petty kings are ephemeral specks of dust in the history of this nation restricted to 2 acre zameen and 2 centuries of time.
</p>

<p>
The Republic, Hinduism, Capitalism&#x2014;these are eternal.
</p>

<p>
Get on that direct train, or be crushed underneath it. COPE AND SEETHE.

<p>
The New System (of property rights, kingship and settled lifestyle) landed in Eridug. Many tribes were unified under the leadership of Alulim there. Slowly, generation-by-generation, the line of Alulim turns darker and eventually the wicked Alalngar takes the throne.
</p>

<p>
In the frontier of the Eridug kingdom, in a settlement called Patibira, in the middle of the night, a settled tribe is attacked by nomadic &ldquo;native&rdquo; ooga-boogas. The En-men (chief) of Patibira is slain and the ooga-boogas fight over NECKSTRVNG OF KINGSHIP. Just as one of the ooga-boogas attains domnance over his competing claimants, the NECKSTRVNG flies away, carried by mighty gusts. He chases it into the darkness; where eventually it vanishes in a flash of light and he roars in frustration.
</p>

<p>
At the ousted tribe&rsquo;s hideout, the widowed queen goes into labour. She dies during childbirth; the regent raises the baby into the air and the NECKSTRVNG of kingship falls on it. He is named EN-MEN LU-ANA as lightning falls from the sky.
</p>

<p>
The tribe used to worship a wild cat that would kill the villagers, and offered human sacrifices to it. EN-MEN-LU-ANA takes the place of one of the human sacrifice candidates and slays the wild cat. The tribe is scandalized. EN-MEN-LU-ANA speaks thus: That wild cat was of no use to us. Why do we worship trees and animals that are of no use to us? Instead, we should decide what plants and animals we want, and MAXX those out instead of letting all these random animals and plants take their space. Instead of going and finding boars and edible plants we should have boars and edible plants HERE. The things we are granted are the SKY and the EARTH and the SVN and the RAIN and the TWO RIVERS; those are what we should worship, everything else must be as we intend. Thus En-men-lu-ana invented AGRICVLTVRE. With AGRICVLTVRE he builds up his tribe&rsquo;s power and reconquers Patibira from the ooga-boogas.
</p>

<p>
In the time of Alulim the first GREAT EN-MEN, there had been a flame he had borne with him as he bestowed the NEW SYSTEM upon the tribes: a flame that was said to have been lit in a MOVNTAIN OF FIRE far, far in the East. This eternal flame had been kept burning in a pit deep in a cave in Eridug; one day, it puffed out. Alalngar (the GREAT EN-MEN of Eridug), commands EN-MEN-LU-ANA (the En-men of Patibira) to venture far away to the East, to find the legendary MOVNTAIN OF FIRE, and re-light the ETERNAL FLAME. Despite Patibira&rsquo;s increasing power, it remained a vassal to Eridug, and thus EN-MEN-LU-ANA accepted the command and ventured to the East.
</p>

<p>
With EN-MEN-LU-ANA gone, Alalngar occupies Patibira completely, burns down its AGRICVLTVRAL farms, placing his davghter as the vassal there, bestowing upon her NECKSTRING OF AUTHORITY, with beads for every great military accomplishment. Shockingly, EN-MEN-LU-ANA succeeds in his mission and retrieves the ETERNAL FLAME OF THE MOUNTAIN IN THE EAST, and brings back with him an army of Eastern ooga-boogas eager to start practising AGRICVLTVRE. When he returns, he is furious. He rips off Alalngar&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s NECKSTRING OF AUTHORITY and scatters the beads; her soldiers + his existing allies immediately switch allegiances to him seeing the army of Eastern ooga-boogas behind him, and Patibira declares complete independence from Eridug.
</p>

<p>
EN-MEN-LU-ANA&rsquo;s allies want to start plotting to take over Eridug, but there are more pressing priorities. He needs to re-BVILD his AGRICVLTVRAL farms. And also he learns that to take Patibira, Alalngar had to take the support of a massive number of ooga-booga tribes; and in doing so he unintentionally brought them together, and now they have a &ldquo;Triumph of the Noble Savage&rdquo; ideology and want to destroy all tribes practising the NEW SYSTEM. So EN-MEN-LU-ANA offers an olive branch to Alalngar, who grudgingly accepts. They start covertly eliminating ooga-booga leaders. EN-MEN-LU-ANA has a lot of fun murdering the specific ooga-booga leader who was responsible for burning down much of the AGRICVLTVRAL farms.
</p>

<p>
When the ooga-boogas realize what&rsquo;s going on, they decide to attack the NEW SYSTEM lands immediately. EN-MEN-LU-ANA and Alalngar agree to band their armies together to finish off the ooga-boogas. Alalngar orders his soldiers &ldquo;do not participate in the fighting, let EN-MEN-LU-ANA handle it all then we&rsquo;ll finish them off&rdquo;. EN-MEN-LU-ANA, anticipating this, had put a lot of effort in the earlier covert warfare and gets some ooga-booga tribes to exclusively attack Alalngar&rsquo;s men, some to turn on their coalition etc. and manages to defeat the ooga-boogas without being cut down too much. Alalngar&rsquo;s army is now both disappointed in their leader and not confident of their ability to win against EN-MEN-LU-ANA, so he beheads Alalngar, marries his daughter and captures Eridug, becoming the GREAT EN-MEN of all the New System tribes. He spreads AGRICVLTVRE far and wide, and the people worship him as the sky god An himself.
</p>

<p>
Three years later, he is slain in battle by the ooga-booga nomadic tribes of the Desert south of the great Oasis. His wife gives birth and he names his child EN-MEN GAL-ANA before he dies. As his remains are divided into halves and tossed into the two rivers to coalesce in the Oasis, his wife takes En-men Gal-ana and runs far to the West away from the usurper who has taken power in the chaos.
</p>

<p>
Once grown up, En-men Gal-ana returns to the Oasis and challenges the usurper. People first mock his claim of being the TRVE SON of EN-MEN-LU-ANA but the in the final battle between him and the usurper the sky itself marks him its TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
En-men Gal-ana reigns long and keeps spreading AGRICVLTVRE.
</p>

<p>
The line of EN-MEN-LU-ANA continues, until it goes into the hands of a certain En-men Dur-ana. When En-men Dur-ana is a prince he tries to woo a girl named Inana by showing her how good he is at AGRICVLTVRE. But a boy challenges him saying: Wheat and boars is great, but I think sheep are even better than boars. We can also use its wool and I like drinking from its teats. Inana prefers En-men Dur-ana&rsquo;s offers to the Sheep boy&rsquo;s, but En-men Dur-ana is incensed by the challenge and sentences the Sheep boy to death. The Sheep boy escapes with Inana&rsquo;s help.
</p>

<p>
The Sheep boy raises an army with the power of SHEEP MILK, and challenges En-men Dur-ana to a duel for the kingship and the hand of Inana. En-men Dur-ana scoffs at the idea, preferring to let his army annihilate the Sheep boy&rsquo;s, but Inana declares she will marry the winner of the duel. The fight goes on for a long time, their clashes shaking the earth and the skies, but neither obviously having the upper-hand. Then, at long last, the clouds break way for the sun and the same mark appears as it did so many years ago for En-men Gal-ana. Nobody there alive had seen that mark, yet they all knew it when they saw it.
</p>

<p>
THE MARK OF THE SKY.
On the Sheep boy,
THE TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;DUMUZID!&rdquo; they cry, meaning: THE TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
Not by blood, that is obvious from a look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;DUMUZID!&rdquo; they cry, meaning: THE TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
But in spirit. In ideas. In SVPERIORITY.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;DUMUZID!&rdquo; they cry, meaning: THE TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
Dumuzid slays En-men Dur-ana, and marries Inana, and takes the title EN-SIPAD-ZID-ANA.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;DUMUZID!&rdquo; they cry, meaning: THE TRVE SON.
</p>

<p>
He says "My invention of sheep milk is one of many to come. This is just the beginning of history (which is important and based, unlike the retard fukupotato who will come many millennia later and tell you about its end).
</p>

<p>
"The night seemed to be at its darkest. The Great Flood had covered the earth. Those who didn&rsquo;t perish in the heat, were swept away in the flood. Those who survived the flood, died to disease. And those who lived through the diseases, died to our own stupid big-brain idea of sacrificing ourselves to ooga-booga animals.
</p>

<p>
"The sky god An himself had to descend upon this Earth to tell us: make the world BE as we intend it to BE i.e. DO AGRICVLTVRE. This is just the beginning, my brethren.

One day, when the night seems to be at its darkest again, when ooga-boogas have swept across the earth, equipped with the products of the genius minds of non-ooga-boogas, when ooga-boogas and non-ooga-boogas alike perish to disease, and to massacres by an ooga-booga religion, then An shall descend upon this earth and give us another genius idea: make the world DO as we intend it to DO, i.e. DO INDVSTRY. I don&rsquo;t know how to do that or what that means as compared to him I will always be an ooga-booga.

A thousand more gurgaons, a gurgaon in your face, a gurgaon up your poop-shoot. you are mortal, but gurgaon is eternal. A million more gurgaons, all your favorite countries will fall, just gurgaons will prevail. No pakistan no bangladesh, just infinite gurgaons. so long as men can see and breathe, there is no higher calling on earth but to populate the universe with gurgaons. Cope and seethe commie.

China is MacOS. Walled garden, but open on the things that matter so that it just works really well. Your life is at their mercy tho.

<p>
Singapore is Linux. Very open market; centralization only in the form of establishing standards. Literally the best at everything, except time-pass. Very small.
</p>

<p>
India is Windows. You can technically do anything, but only after going through a ton of useless bureaucracy that god knows where to find. Lots of stuff just broken. Total lack of perfectionism. Open market for viruses mainly.
</p>

<p>
America is an Arch linux installation that has gotten fakkḍ up beyond repair. Random bloatware everywhere. At some point you recompiled the kernel; your uncle says this made a malicious AI take over your computer from within and it uploads little copies of itself onto the internet to infect other systems. There is no driver for the keyboard so you enter inputs by scanning pieces of paper with the camera.

Europe is iOS. Literally only exists to be a pain in the ass for anyone who wants to BVILD anything.
</p>

UK is Unix. The original perfect system which America made a democratic version of (Linux). Now dead.

Gulf countries are Android. Very lite system based on Linux. Little boys play with them in bed.

super poker game going on.  Trump is like the bully with a lot of existing chips playing bluff to getting everyone else to fold without neccesarily playing based on the cards.  but we have just moved from the blinds to the flop, still two rounds left
</p>

<p>
its a very entertaining style of play in poker but not neccesarily the most rational way to play.  i know it because i also play this way🤣

The wignats have chanced upon Big-braining theory. NiṣādaHermaphroditarchaṃśa (Mal&rsquo;ta boy ka parivar) thought continues to gain followers.

I dont like how many rightwingers, usually big accounts dabble in useless spheres just to search for hot takes, trying to reach a higher plane of understanding, they dont know or care that these hot takes are usually a botched defense of liberalism or straight up wrong.

I&rsquo;ve been saying that Inceliyat is the mother of Islamism since before I knew about this. Never doubt the wisdom of NiṣādaHermaphroditarchaṃśa (Mal&rsquo;ta boy ka parivar) thought.

Told you it&rsquo;s cause they&rsquo;re short.

<p>
Why would you ever question the wisdom of NiṣādaHermaphroditarchaṃśa (Mal&rsquo;ta boy ka parivar) thought?

If Emperor Napoleon can get up to vote for Trump then so can you.
