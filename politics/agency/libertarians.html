<p>
In the wake of the Libertarian Party self-nuking by obsessively batting for Bangladeshi illegal immigration, beef and finally admitting to colluding with the Biden SEC against India Inc—I wrote a post of advice for all the shocked and disgruntled Indian libertarians I am seeing in their comments.
</p>

<p>
Although it is addressed to libertarians, it applies equally to all &ldquo;hardline ideologically Right-Wing&rdquo; groups: libertarians, trads, anti-reservation warriors, whatever. We want you here, and it is important to prevent you from falling into rabbitholes of uselessness (called &ldquo;bhōsaḍpilling&rdquo; in these parts) and being a sucker for Congressi ops.
</p>

<p>
RT &amp; share widely.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<i>I didn&rsquo;t want it to be this way.</i>
</p>

<p>
My first introduction to right-wing politics was through libertarianism, after I took a political compass test as a teenager and it put me in the Lib Right quadrant saying &ldquo;your views are closest to Milton Friedman&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
(Before that I had a vague sense of &ldquo;well capitalism is good because we need a profit motive&rdquo; but also easily fell for monkey-balancing moderation like &ldquo;oh but surely some socialism in healthcare is ok? think of the healthcare!&rdquo;)
</p>

<p>
And as far as actual policies go I am still basically a libertarian (definitely on economics, and on some important social issues like guns and hate speech laws, though for non-libertarian reasons).
</p>

<p>
And I assure you I am far more educated on economics and libertarianism than these potbellied unkils sitting in a podcast going &ldquo;Aaaas Miltan Fried Man saaaid! &#x2026;&rdquo; :)
</p>

<p>
But here&rsquo;s the thing: <i>politics isn&rsquo;t just about policy and ideology</i>. It&rsquo;s not about having the correct opinions, supporting anyone who expresses the same opinions, and autistically calculating which party is closest to your positions.
</p>

<p>
One overcorrection is to say: <i>politics is about power</i>. Instead, I will say: politics, like any endeavour, is about these three things:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b><i>Ideology.</i></b> Having a vision for the world (e.g. policies). These are your terminal goals — the reason you want political power in the first place.</li>

<li><b><i>Execution.</i></b>  Implementation/organizing and working tirelessly to gain power and implement this vision. This includes building workable electoral alliances, and it also includes &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; change (both in terms of economic education and simply making instilling a positive attitude towards industrialization, capitalists, creative destruction, etc.)</li>

<li><b><i>World models.</i></b> Correctly understanding the game and the battlefield you are playing on. Who the players are, what they want, their degrees of power—the ability to recognize enemies (śatrubodha) and friends (mitrabodha, as coined by @Akshay<sub>VAK</sub>)</li>
</ol>

<p>
<i>Goals, actions and knowledge.</i>
</p>

<p>
Having the right ideology is easy. You are not a genius for having figured it out; nor is everyone else who figured it out a genius whom you now need to become chaḍḍi-buddies with or simp for.
</p>

<p>
But things don&rsquo;t happen at the stroke of a pen.
</p>

<p>
&lt;&lt;&lt;and hey, before you read the rest—I know there will be some of you I will not be able to reach. Those who are already too deep in dark and filthy bhōsaḍpiller rabbitholes, filled with seethe and bursting out frothing at the mouth at anyone who offers you a hand.
</p>

<p>
That is the one sort of person I have never been able to persuade, because I have no way of relating to them. This essay is for the type of person who aspires for greatness, but has a degree of childish naivety.&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Maybe you should ask yourself less: <i>&ldquo;What (ideologically) differentiates me from Modi, Yogi, BJP?&rdquo;</i> and more: <i>&ldquo;What differentiates me from Milton Friedman, Javier Milei, Elon Musk?&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
(similarly if you are a &ldquo;trad&rdquo; reading this: <i>&ldquo;What differentiates me from Puṣyamitra Śuṅga or Ādi Śankara?&rdquo;</i>)
</p>

<p>
What is it that lets these guys execute their ideology and actually get their ideas implemented while you jerk it listening to a podcast between some kid and a 45-year old bachelor?
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s a hard question. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in kayfabe: become friends with everyone who has the same ideology! Start a &ldquo;centre for liberty&rdquo;! Start a party! Give interviews to the media!
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; you will get manipulated by bad-faith actors like Shekhar Gupta or American &ldquo;centrist YIMBY abundance liberals&rdquo; who say all the right things while actually working for leftists.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; in fact, you will be manipulated into supporting anything as long as it is coated in libertarian sprinkles. You will support cracking down on businesses because they&rsquo;re &ldquo;actually crony capitalists not capitalists&rdquo;. You will support draconian environmental regulations because &ldquo;negative externalities!&rdquo;. You will vote for some third-party because &ldquo;both parties are socialist anyway&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
(if you don&rsquo;t believe me, look at all the American &ldquo;centrist YIMBY abundance liberals&rdquo; falling over for Zohran Mamdani.)

<h3 id="orgd01affb"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> II. The things-are-hard pill.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
<i>Things are hard.</i> What you are doing is like playing a war game and just keep clicking attack on everyone hoping that somehow something will happen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no free lunch&rdquo; actually doesn&rsquo;t only apply in the context of markets, it applies in basically all large games. When the world is populated by intelligent beings all pursuing their goals, any ten-dollar-bill on the footpath (if there is one :)) has been picked up.
</p>

<p>
This is the <i>things-are-hard pill</i> — reconciling the whitepill and blackpill like how information economics reconciles the Efficient Market Hypothesis with the fact that the financial industry exists.
</p>

<p>
You have to approach politics like entrepreneurship. You don&rsquo;t build a great company by idly doing kayfabe things like registering a company and wearing a suit and giving kayfabe talks. You do it by being very agentic in figuring out exactly what the best way to create value is, and working very hard to do it.

<h3 id="org798e554"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> III. You think Modi doesn&rsquo;t know?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The thing that was funniest to me about this Libertarian Party&rsquo;s antics was their repeated insistence that &ldquo;BJP is socialist, Modi-Shah don&rsquo;t understand capitalism&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; really? The guys who
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>took India from Rank 142 to Rank 63 in Ease of Doing Business</li>
<li>crushed the Naxal insurgency</li>
<li>doubled our highway network in 10 years</li>
<li>doubled the number of functional airports in the country, created a massive expansion in ports, urban transit, canals, logistics all led by private-players</li>
<li>proposed the farm bill and land acquisition bill</li>
<li>are pushing farm/land/labor deregulations at the state level in the states where it is politically possible</li>
<li>incubated a very impressive defense startup ecosystem you saw in action during Operation Sindoor</li>
<li>implemented the world&rsquo;s most successful DOGE &amp; anti-corruption initiative with Direct Benefit Transfer and UPI</li>
</ul>

<p>
do not know?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not enough. 6-7% growth is not enough, we need to catch up with China sooner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I hear you.
</p>

<p>
<i>But Gujarat exists.</i>
</p>

<p>
Gujarat exists to show what Modi&rsquo;s vision for India is. Which means that the bottleneck to &ldquo;doing more&rdquo; is not wrong ideology, but that things-are-hard. That executing is hard.
</p>

<p>
No petty suspicion thrown at Modi could ever stick &#x2026; <i>because Gujarat exists</i>.
</p>

<p>
Does this mean Modi is secretly a libertarian ideologue who lands exactly on your sub-sub-pixel of the political compass? Obviously not.
</p>

<p>
But it&rsquo;s irrelevant. Even if you see Modi as an imperfect figure (he&rsquo;s not, btw), you do not have the luxury of lashing out at everyone who is not from your sub-sub-pixel.
</p>

<p>
This
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>opposing BJP because they&rsquo;re not exactly 100% aligned with you</li>
<li>opposing Adani because he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;crony capitalist&rdquo;</li>
<li>the section of Orthodoxy that opposed Shivaji&rsquo;s coronation arguing &ldquo;Marāṭhas are not Kṣatriyas&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
is what we call <i>bhōsaḍpilling</i>: lashing out at the only people doing anything (Executing) because their Ideology is not pure enough.
</p>

<p>
Am I saying Modi-Shah should never be criticized? I will quote Lolbert Pitāmāh&rsquo;s eternal wisdom on this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Its very simple
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>proven competence high integrity high skin in the game =&gt; no criticism</li>
<li>doubtful competence, low skin in the game =&gt; ok to criticize in a measured way</li>
<li>doubtful neeyat=&gt; dharma to criticize</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
Modi-Shah are 1 on most things they touch. They are 2 on a few things, but ask me first what these things are before criticizing. There&rsquo;s nothing they&rsquo;re 3 on.

<h3 id="org5baffda"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> IV. So what can libertarians actually do?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
&ldquo;Ok, so things are hard, and you should approach politics like entrepreneurship. Do you have any startup ideas for us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll say:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcb37f3f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcb37f3f"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1.</span> Focus on cultural change.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">
<p>
(i.e. to make people more receptive to free-market policies)
</p>

<p>
This is not just about economic education (although it is a part of it). People need stories, media, art depicting capitalists as heroes and geniuses. There&rsquo;s a reason Ayn Rand sells and your chutiya podcasts don&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
I want to see libertarians make a &ldquo;The Men who Built America&rdquo; type show about Adani-Ambani. Instead we have a libertarian party that sues Adani because the Biden administration told them to.
</p>

<p>
Often it&rsquo;s not even about making your own art and movies but building an &ldquo;Infrastructure of Reception&rdquo;—interpreting existing art that has right-wing themes into your ideological framework and using it to push your ideology. Think KGF (yes seriously).
</p>

<p>
Something I have said before:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A big problem with RW propaganda is it only fights at the superficial level—valorizing one-off leaders or events—rather than trying to make fundamental cultural changes (promoting capitalism, Hindu sovereignty etc).
</p>

<p>
At least, your biopics should emphasize the character&rsquo;s RW ideas, rather than promoting him by relying on promoting how much jai-kisān Modi is or how Shivaji was fair toward Muslims.
</p>

<p>
(Outside of election contexts) promoting the clip of Modi saying &ldquo;I feel pride when our businesses succeed&rdquo; or Ajit Doval saying &ldquo;as far as I&rsquo;m concerned the entire country is right-wing&rdquo; is infinitely more effective than appealing to existing left-wing or normie memes.

<p>
Investigate what the most significant obstacles are to free market reforms, e.g. material obstacles like people don&rsquo;t want creative destruction in their occupation, as well as institutional obstacles like tough unions etc.
</p>

<p>
For material obstacles, figure out what compromises can be reached (e.g. &ldquo;just pay off the taxi drivers with the surplus generated&rdquo;). For institutional obstacles, figure out how those people can be made unpopular and weakened (go back to: cultural change).
</p>

<p>
Figure out what are the main constituencies for socialist policies (apart from the overwhelming global force of Left-liberalism), and what compromises can be reached.
</p>

<p>
Prioritize. Focus on policies that have the most impact (are most valuable economically), rather than going with whatever has &ldquo;wind&rdquo; or whatever scratches your itch.

<h4 id="orgae226bb"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.3.</span> Focus on actually-neglected issues.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-3">
<p>
I don&rsquo;t mean issues that are politically impossible to touch, like reservations. Stop trying to bully the govt on that, they&rsquo;re trying their best.
</p>

<p>
I mean issues that are neglected out of lack of information or genuine oversight. A glaring one is urban governance: FSI/FAR regulations, rent controls, all sorts of building code regulations, and the overall shitty state of our cities.
</p>

<p>
But the fact that BJP leadership has its heart in the right place means you should direct your advocacy to BJP leadership, in good faith. If instead you are posting to an audience for clout &ldquo;look what BJP didn&rsquo;t do&rdquo;, that is bhōsaḍpilling.

Do not see yourself as a customer. See yourself as a party worker, whose job is to convey important information to the BJP leadership, convince them on things you think they&rsquo;re genuinely wrong on/neglecting.
</p>

<p>
&gt; Observation: RWs primarily see themselves as &ldquo;customers&rdquo; to be pleased by their party, while leftists see themselves as &ldquo;party workers&rdquo;.
&gt;
&gt; Leftists instead see &ldquo;disadvantaged groups&rdquo; etc. as the customers.
&gt;
&gt; This is the cause of a lot of b**sadpilling and uselessness from RWs.

<h4 id="org94fa6f9"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.4.</span> Understand that &ldquo;Libertarians&rdquo;/&ldquo;Trads&rdquo; are not a special constituency from the rest of the Right-Wing and your interests are the same as the rest of us.</h4>

<p>
This is for a broader question of &ldquo;What should Right-wingers do?&rdquo; that I will write about at some point.
</p>

<p>
But the basic point is: getting your ideology pushed doesn&rsquo;t only depend on pushing your ideology &#x2026; it also depends on getting power for your group, which is right-wingers.
</p>

<p>
And very often, the means to get power may be neither libertarian nor trad.

<div id="outline-container-orgd04cdd0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd04cdd0"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.5.</span> Power is power.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-5">
<p>
This is the fundamental reason I do not use labels like &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; or &ldquo;trad&rdquo; to describe myself: ideology is not orthogonal to execution &#x2026; and if you let &ldquo;principles&rdquo; restrain your pursuit of power, <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
In large part this is why Classical Liberalism lost to Left-liberalism in the West. Classical Liberalism suffered from <i>Yudhiṣṭhira syndrome</i>, restraining itself out of &ldquo;principles&rdquo;, even as its enemy showed no such principles.
</p>

<p>
Again, the world is populated by intelligent beings trying to maximize their goals. If you let go of any opportunity for power out of &ldquo;principle&rdquo;, someone else will seize it and use it against you.
</p>

<p>
The path to power may involve authoritarian policies, it may involve libertarian policies. It may involve compromise, it may involve making alliances with people not totally in alignment with you. It may involve RETVRNing to tradition, or it may involve adapting to modernity.
</p>

<p>
The path to power may be hard to stomach for an ideologue. But flinch from it, and <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you restrain yourselves from purging your enemies&rsquo; &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; when necessary, <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you restrain yourself from getting filmmakers to fall in line with your ideology, <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you restrain yourself from rewarding those who support you, <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you restrain yourself from curbing the demographics of those who want to kill you, <i>you will lose</i>.
</p>

<p>
NOTHING is possible without power, and nothing is worse than losing.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you want to keep your hands clean. That&rsquo;s fine. But at least be thankful to the goy who presses the lift buttons for you. At least be thankful to the Bhīma who strikes Duryodhana in the thigh and takes the bad karma for you. Learn to stay silent when we do the dirty work for you.
</p>

<p>
Win first. We can change the game once we win it.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
I think it is a great tragedy that nearly every &ldquo;ideologically hardline right-winger&rdquo; ends up bhōsaḍpilling.
</p>

<p>
Clarity of vision, having a positive vision is important. Having &ldquo;good cops (moderates) and bad cops (ideologues)&rdquo; is important. And this is why I will always extend a hand to those with principled ideology; you are needed in the Right Wing.
</p>

<p>
Just stop doing useless things, and start doing useful things. Understand that BJP/Sangh is literally the only political institution in India (meme ones aside) that we can even say has its heart in the right place. Distrust anyone who does not pledge absolute loyalty to it.

Man, I&rsquo;ve tried my best to tell you that politics isn&rsquo;t about &ldquo;sappotting&rdquo; things. I don&rsquo;t like any of these things, but I understand that
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>govt isn&rsquo;t omnipotent, it takes effort to fix things, and you have to compromise with other powers and democratic constraints</li>
<li>some things need to be done to get and maintain power</li>
</ol>

<p>
BJP tried going into the 2024 election without any significant freebies (something unheard of previously in Indian politics) and it backfired terribly. I don&rsquo;t like freebies, but I would rather have some freebies than have Rahul Gandhi come to power and create a full Maoist Raj.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
It is impossible to argue with someone who doesn&rsquo;t appreciate political costs and evaluate it against the actual importance of the policy, and prioritize based on that.
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; and the very fact that you choose to focus almost exclusively on the issues with High Political Cost and Low Economic Impact, rather than the reverse, is why you are NGMI. If you were a serious person, you would be talking about FSI/FAR regulations and rent control in Mumbai, not continuously touching third rails.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
You want to know the political cost of &ldquo;freeing temples&rdquo;? The moment you do so, you will see at least a few isolated cases of &ldquo;caste discrimination&rdquo; in the privatized temples (yes I know it is their individual property right, that&rsquo;s not the point). These cases will be picked up by the Congress ecosystem and amplified throughout the country to fuel an oppression narrative like never seen before and bring Maoist Rahul Gandhi to power &#x2026; <i>forever</i>.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some moderate compromise solution can be crafted and reached. But are <i>you</i> working on that, if it&rsquo;s such a priority to you? It&rsquo;s not a priority to me, and based on your revealed preferences it&rsquo;s not a priority to you either, just something to morally grandstand against Modi over.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Jokers like you will say BJP is &ldquo;blackmailing&rdquo; you with the prospect of Rahul Gandhi coming to power. Like BJP has any vested interest in caste census, freebies, corrupt congress netas, interest-free loans to waqf, or temples under govt control.
</p>

<p>
The idea that BJP &ldquo;supports&rdquo; any of these things is so self-evidently stupid. The only reason we&rsquo;re even speaking about half of these things is because electing Modi brought it into the Overton window.
</p>

<p>
<i>Things are hard. Less moral grandstanding, more doing.</i> Now get to work.
